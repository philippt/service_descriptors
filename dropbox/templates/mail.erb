Dear user,

I just installed the dropbox client application on your virtualop server <%= params["machine"] %>.
I need your assistance for the setup process - please login to the dropbox account you want to synchronize onto this machine and then hit the following URL:
  <%= url %>
  
I will wait an hour now to continue the installation process - if you want to finish the installation process later, please re-start it.

Thank you very much for your cooperation,
Marvin
