# see http://li.nux.ro/repos.html
# Summary: A desktop and multimedia oriented RPM repository for EL6. It contains a lot of graphical programs such as Ardour, but also text based apps line Cone.
# Notes: This repository is made to coexist with Fedora EPEL; it will probably conflict badly with Repoforge/RPMforge and ATrpms and possibly other repos. I try hard not to overwrite Base.
